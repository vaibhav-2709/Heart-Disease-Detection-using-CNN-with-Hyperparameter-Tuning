This project focuses on detecting heart disease using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture combined with hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize performance. It leverages deep learning to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification
- GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV / KerasTuner for hyperparameter tuning
- Trained on a structured dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease)
- Achieves high accuracy, precision, and recall
- Evaluation metrics: Confusion Matrix, ROC AUC, Accuracy, etc.

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib

The tuned CNN model significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to a baseline model. Hyperparameter tuning was applied to:
- Number of layers and neurons
- Activation functions
- Learning rate
- Batch size and epochs
